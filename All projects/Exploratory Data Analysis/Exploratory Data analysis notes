def: discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis, check assumptions


steps:

1) Read the data head columns and first 10 rows
2) Understand the shape, columns and data types
3) Identify attribute type
4) Print index of all value counts of each column
5) describe each column and find out whether each column in categorical or continuous
6) print categorical count values of categorical attributes
7) identify missing values
8) convert all "." symbol to nan, None values to nan, missing values to nan
9) convert all numerical features either to float or to int, note: it has to be uniform
10) print mean, variance, std
11) plot kdeplot from seaborn to find whether two columns are closely related or not
12) If two columns have similar mean, variance, std, min, max etc then that may conclude that they are 
    closely related.
13) kurtosis method to measure peakedness of the data






Kurtosis is a method used to find outliers in data

platykurtic(thin tails, kurtosis value is close to 3)
mesokurtic(medium tails, kurtosis value is less than 3)
leptokurtic(fat tails, kurtosis value is greater than 3)

If kurtosis value is extremely large, then that shows a possibility for outliers

Finding 25, 50 and 75 quartile range

Inter Quartile Range(IQR) is a measure of variability, it is the distance between the first
and third quartile
