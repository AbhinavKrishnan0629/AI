Time series: Stationary and Non stationary

Stationary: observations like mean and variance are consistant over time and do not depend on time

Stationary process: A process that generates a stationary series of observations
Stationary model  : A model that describes stationary series of observations
Trend stationary  : A time series that doesnt exhibit a trend
Season stationary : A time series that doesnt exhibit seasonality
Strictly stationary

Generally make your time series stationary
Its easier for models to work with stationary time series
Remove trend and seasonality from time series

Its advised to treat properties of time series being stationary or not as another piece of information for feature engineering


Methods to check for stationarity
1) Look at plots: visually check for trends and seasonality
2) Summary statistics: you can review the summary statistics for your data for seasons or random partitions and check for obvious or large differences
3) Statistical tests
