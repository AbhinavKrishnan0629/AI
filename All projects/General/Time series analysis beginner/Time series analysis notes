Time series: Stationary and Non stationary

Stationary: observations like mean and variance are consistant over time and do not depend on time

Stationary process: A process that generates a stationary series of observations
Stationary model  : A model that describes stationary series of observations
Trend stationary  : A time series that doesnt exhibit a trend
Season stationary : A time series that doesnt exhibit seasonality
Strictly stationary

Generally make your time series stationary
Its easier for models to work with stationary time series
Remove trend and seasonality from time series

Its advised to treat properties of time series being stationary or not as another piece of information for feature engineering


Methods to check for stationarity
1) Look at plots: visually check for trends and seasonality
2) Summary statistics: you can review the summary statistics for your data for seasons or random partitions and check for obvious or large differences
3) Statistical tests

Augmented Dicky Fuller test(Unit root test)
It determines how strongly a time series is affected by trend
It uses an autoregressive model and optimizes an information criterion over different lag values


Making the time series stationary:
->if there is a positive general trend, then use transformation like log, square root, cube root
->Aggregation, taking average over time like monthly or yearly average
->Smoothing: taking rolling means
->Polynomial fitting: Fit a regression model

Eliminating trend and seasonality:
->Differencing: taking difference with a particular time lag
->Decomposition: modeling both trend and seasonality and removing them from model
