First question to ask yourself:
Are outliers and Noise the same?

Outliers: An Outlier is that observation which is significantly different from all other observations.
Anomalies: A false data point made by different processes than the rest of the data

Outliers are sometimes helpful

Deletion of outliers is not always healthy unless and until you analyze the data

Outliers affect : mean, standard deviation, range
Outliers doesnt affect : Median, IQR

Drop an outlier if:
1) If you are sure its wrong
2) You have a lot of data in hand
3) You have an option to go back

Dont drop an outlier if:
1) Your results are critical
2) You have a lot of outliers (around 25 percent or so)

Outlier detection: A data point significantly off the average and, depending on the goal, either removing or resolving them from the analysis to prevent skewing is known as outlier detection.

Outliers are caused by:
1) Intentional(dummy outliers are created to test detection models)
2) Data processing errors(Data manipulation or data set unintended mutations)
3) Sampling errors(extracting or mixing data from wrong or various sources)
4) Natural(not an error but novelties the data)
5) Data entry error(Human error)


Different ways to treat an outlier

1) Trimming
- Fastest way
- Makes the dataset thin if many outliers are present

2) Capping
- Consider all data points above a threshold value as outliers
- Capping number: no of outliers hence found

3) Considering them as missing values

4) Discretization
- Making groups. Considering all outliers in a separate group and forcing them to behave the way other groups do


Detecting outliers

1) Normal distributions
- Here use empirical normal distribution formulas, ex: mean+or-3*stddeviation beyond which all are outliers

2) Skewed distributions
- Use Inter - Quartile Range(IQR) approximity rule

Important methods to detect outliers are:
1) Z-score
2) IQR
3) DBSCAN : Density Based Spatial Clustering Application with Noise
- Mahalanobis distance method(for multivariate outliers), Box and whishker or box plot - B Tukeys method
4) LOF    : Local Outlier Factor
5) one-class SVM
6) PyCaret
7) PyOD
8) Prophet
9) 

-SciPy and Numpy are used to visualize
